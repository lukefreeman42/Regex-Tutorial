    "A Middle Eastern company is responsible for daily distribution of over 230 million liters of oil products. For this distribution network, a failure scenario is defined as an occurring when oil transport is interrupted or slows down, and/or when products demands fluctuates outside the normal range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under all failure scenarios, the company plans to provide additional transport capacity at minimum cost so as to meet all point-to point product demands. Currently, the company uses a wait-and-see strategy, which carries a high operating cost and depends on the availability of third-party transportation. Using advanced forecasting methods will allow risks to be optimized, failure scenarios more accurately predicted and lead to better more cost-effective responses."

Insted of waiting for one to break, have the village complain, and then send someone out (wait and see). We can use Forecasting to predict which pumps are more likely to be damaged, and premptively send inspectors to those locations first."
